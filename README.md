Goal for All-in-the-pi

We are trying to make a raspberrypi robot that will display a google calendar, read off a todo list or task list and then show photos when it senses motion. The raspberrypi robot should remind it's owner of any events or task they have to do that day, update them on current events that intrest them and to stop and smell the roses with pictures of family and friends.
